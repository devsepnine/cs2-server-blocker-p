- Windows OS

## ? FAQ

---
- How does it work and can I get banned from the game?
  - This program does not manipulate CS2 game files or system files, it simply modifies firewall policies to block server connections.
- Why do I need administrator privileges?
  - Firewall policies require Windows administrator privileges. Server blocking cannot be performed in normal mode, so administrator privileges are required.
