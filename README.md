# FAQ

Q. How does it work? Is there any risk of getting banned from the game?

A. This program works by using Windows' built-in firewall functionality to block connections to specific server IP addresses. It does not modify or touch CS2 game files, processes, or memory at all.

Therefore, there is no concern of being detected by Valve's anti-cheat (VAC) system, and you can use it safely without the risk of game bans.

Q. Why do I need administrator privileges?

A. Adding or modifying Windows firewall rules is a sensitive operation that can affect the network security of the entire system. Therefore, Windows requires administrator privileges when performing such changes. Since this program needs to control firewall rules, it must be run with administrator privileges for normal operation.

Q. A SmartScreen warning saying "Windows protected your PC" appears. Is it safe?

A. Yes, it is safe. Microsoft displays such warnings when a program is not from an officially registered developer (publisher) or is not well-known.

To officially distribute an app, developers must pay fees and obtain a 'code signing certificate' to sign their programs. This program is a free open-source program created by an individual developer, so it is not signed separately, which causes the warning to appear.

You can start the program by clicking 'More info' and then pressing the 'Run anyway' button as shown below.
